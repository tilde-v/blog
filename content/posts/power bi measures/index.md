# power bi measures
it clicked for me when i realised a measure is something that always evaluates into a single value.
initially i assumed it was basically the same as a calculated column, so struggled to figure out how to use them properly.

## simplest case: sum
if you drag a column into a field for a visual, power bi will automatically convert it into one of a few basic figures (sum, average, etc.)
